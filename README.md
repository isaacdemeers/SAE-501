- Enter your email and check the email in Mailpit at port 8025.
- Click the link in the email to modify your password. Note: The token is valid for one attempt only.

## Generate JWT Keys

- Go to the `back` container of the Docker app-php.
- Run the command: `php bin/console lexik:jwt:generate-keypair`

## Verify Account Status

- Check the account verification status by entering the user ID in the `GET users/{id}` route.
- The account is verified if `emailverify = true`.
